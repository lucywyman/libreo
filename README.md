libreo
======

Libreo, redesigned to replace php with nodejs. Now with ES6!

Building
--------
Since we're using swanky ES6 you'll need to build before running the site.
```sh
$ gulp build
```

Testing
-------
```sh
$ gulp test
```

Or, you can be fancy and watch your tests succeed and fail *while you edit your
code*.
```sh
$ gulp test.watch
```
